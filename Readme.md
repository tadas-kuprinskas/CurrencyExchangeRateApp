It is expected that a currency pair can contain any combination of the mentioned currencies (including DKK), e.g. EUR/USD. If a currency pair has the same ISO currency as both main and money, then the passed amount should be returned. If a currency pair contains an unknown currency, then an appropriate error message should be written to console.

It is expected that the code includes tests for the solution elements.

## Requirement

Please provide a solution in C#

You may use any frameworks (testing, mocking etc.) as long as it is freeware and available for download from nuget.org or embedded in your solution.

Please donâ€™t integrate with any kind of databases. Use of filesystem is ok, but you are welcome to hardcode the exchange rates supplied.

## Usage

Run the application. Type the currency pair (i.e. DKK/USD) with the desired amount and press Enter.
